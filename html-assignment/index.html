            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Maimonah Rahaman. I know it is hard to pronounce my name, so I go by <em>moon!</em> I am originally from Bangladesh, but I was raised in Saudi Arabia, and now I am in Canada. I came here on 26<sup>th</sup> of December, so it has been a month. I was always interested in graphic designs and coding, so I thought <abbr title="Interactive Media Designs">IMD</abbr> will be the best program to choose.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, practicing photography, and exploring the city. During the pandemic I took up a new hobby of crocheting. I have crocheted many things, like table mat, tissue box cover, beanie and shawl. I love travelling to different countries, so coming here I can check it off from my bucket list. </p>
